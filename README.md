- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Edegarts
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in databases(SQL/no-SQL) and development (C#,Python, AWS, Ruby).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about  no-SQL databases and  development languages.
- I'm looking to collaborate with projects that use SQL, as I have a few years' experience working on Oracle-related projects and a little use of C# .
